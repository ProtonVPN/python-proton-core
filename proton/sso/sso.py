    Note that it is advised not to try to "guess" the state of the session, but instead to just try to use it, and handle any exception that would arise.

    This object uses advisory locks (using ``flock``) to protect the session from multiple conflicting changes. This does not guarantee that
    Session objects are immune to what happens in another process (i.e. imagine if one process terminates the session.), but at least makes it consistent.
    In the future, it would be nice to use an IPC mechanism to make sure other processes are aware of the state change.
